# Rock or Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview

This project develops a binary classification model to distinguish between rocks and mines using SONAR signals. The model is built using Logistic Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm. The goal is to accurately classify unseen SONAR readings as either 'Rock' (R) or 'Mine' (M).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of SONAR signals collected from various sources. Each row represents a single SONAR return, characterized by 60 continuous numerical features (representing energy at different frequencies), and a target label indicating whether the object is a 'Rock' (R) or a 'Mine' (M).

* **Size:** 208 samples, 60 features + 1 target variable.
* **File:** `Copy of sonar data.csv`

## Methodology

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:** The dataset was loaded using Pandas, and initial checks were performed for data shape, descriptive statistics, and class distribution.
2.  **Feature and Target Separation:** The 60 SONAR signal features were separated from the 'Rock'/'Mine' target label.
3.  **Train-Test Split:** The dataset was split into training and testing sets (90% training, 10% testing) using `stratify` to maintain class proportions.
4.  **Feature Scaling:** `StandardScaler` was applied to standardize the features. This is crucial for Logistic Regression, as it is sensitive to feature scales.
5.  **Model Training (Logistic Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning):**
    * A Logistic Regression model was chosen for its interpretability and efficiency.
    * `GridSearchCV` was employed to perform hyperparameter tuning, searching for the optimal `C` (regularization strength) and `penalty` (`l1` or `l2`) using 5-fold cross-validation. This step helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization.
6.  **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance was evaluated using:
    * Accuracy Score (on both training and test data).
    * [**Future additions for you:** You can also add Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix here once you integrate them.]
7.  **Prediction System:** A simple system to predict the object type for new SONAR readings.

## Code Structure

* `[Sonar-Rock-Mine-Classifier].ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
* `Copy of sonar data.csv`: The dataset used for the project.

## How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/abdulbasit0340/Sonar-Rock-Mine-Classifier.git](https://github.com/abdulbasit0340/Sonar-Rock-Mine-Classifier.git)
    cd YourRepoName
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(You'll create this file in the next section)*
4.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Then open `[Sonar-Rock-Mine-Classifier].ipynb` and run the cells.

## Results

* **Training Accuracy:** [0.8235294117647058]%
* **Test Accuracy:** [ 0.7142857142857143]%


## Future Improvements

* Explore other machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
* Perform more extensive feature engineering (e.g., creating polynomial features, interaction terms).
* Conduct more detailed error analysis using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Investigate dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.
